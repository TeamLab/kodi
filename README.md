# KODI: Korean Diffusion for Image Generation

KODI is a diffusion model that generates high-quality Korean cultural images from Korean text prompts. It uses a Korean CLIP-based text encoder to better understand Korean prompts and generate culturally appropriate images.


## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeamLab/kodi.git
cd kodi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“Š Datasets and Benchmarks

### Korean Cultural Dataset (KCD)
Our Korean cultural training dataset is located at:
```
korean-cultural-dataset/
```
This dataset contains Korean cultural images with corresponding Korean text descriptions.

### MC-K Evaluation Benchmark
The Korean cultural evaluation benchmark MC-K is available at:
```
evaluation/benchmark/
```
This benchmark is used for evaluating cultural appropriateness and Korean language understanding.



## ðŸ”§ Usage

### 1. Model Training

```bash
# Train KODI with Korean Cultural Dataset (KCD)
python training/train_kodi.py --config training/configs/kodi.py
```

### 2. Image Generation

```bash
# Generate images with evaluation dataset
python evaluation/generate_eval_images.py
```

### 3. Model Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate with MC-K benchmark using KC-CLIP
python evaluation/evaluate_by_kcclip.py
```
